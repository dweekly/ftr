# Instructions for AI Agents

This document contains important guidelines and information for AI agents working with the ftr (Fast TRaceroute) codebase.

## Initial Setup

### Installing Git Hooks
**IMPORTANT**: Git hooks must be installed to prevent issues that would fail in CI:
```bash
# Option 1: Install hooks via symlinks
./.githooks/install-hooks.sh

# Option 2: Configure git to use .githooks directory
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

Without these hooks, code with formatting issues or clippy warnings can be committed and will fail in GitHub Actions CI.

## Critical Safety Rules

### Git Commands to NEVER Run
- **NEVER run `git reset`** - This can lose work and is too dangerous. Ask the user to run it if needed.
- **NEVER run `git push --force`** - This can overwrite remote history.
- **NEVER run `git rebase -i`** - Interactive commands don't work in non-interactive environments.
- **NEVER modify `.git/config`** - The user has specifically configured their git settings.

## Environment Configuration

### Building on Windows with Parallels Mount
When building on Windows where the source directory is a Parallels mount (e.g., Y:\), you MUST use the `--target-dir` flag to specify a local Windows directory for the build artifacts. The Parallels filesystem doesn't handle temporary file operations correctly, causing "The parameter is incorrect. (os error 87)" errors.

**Correct build command:**
```bash
cargo build --target-dir C:/temp/ftr-target
```

**Important notes:**
- Use forward slashes (/) not backslashes (\) in the path - they work on Windows and avoid escaping issues
- The `--target-dir` flag must be used directly with cargo; setting CARGO_TARGET_DIR environment variable doesn't work reliably
- DO NOT create .cargo/config.toml in the shared directory as it would affect macOS builds
- The built executable will be at: `C:/temp/ftr-target/debug/ftr.exe`

**Alternative methods that also work:**

From PowerShell directly:
```powershell
$env:CARGO_TARGET_DIR="C:\temp\ftr-target"; cargo build
```

From bash calling PowerShell:
```bash
powershell -Command '$env:CARGO_TARGET_DIR="C:\temp\ftr-target"; cargo build'
```

**What doesn't work:**
- `set CARGO_TARGET_DIR=C:\temp\ftr-target && cargo build` - environment variable not picked up by cargo in same command
- `cmd /c "set CARGO_TARGET_DIR=C:\temp\ftr-target && cargo build"` - variable doesn't persist to cargo
- Using backslashes in paths with --target-dir flag - causes parsing issues

### ENVIRONMENT.md
Each development environment should have an `ENVIRONMENT.md` file that contains environment-specific configuration. This file is NOT checked into version control and is listed in `.gitignore`.

If `ENVIRONMENT.md` doesn't exist, create it using the following schema:

```markdown
# Environment Configuration

This file contains environment-specific configuration and is NOT checked into version control.

## Host System
- **OS**: [Operating system name and version]
- **Platform**: [Platform identifier, e.g., darwin, linux, windows]
- **Working Directory**: [Full path to project directory]
- **Available Tools**: 
  - [List of relevant tools and their versions]

## Virtual Machines
[For each VM, include:]

### [VM Name]
- **OS**: [Operating system and version]
- **IP**: [IP address if applicable]
- **Username**: [Username for SSH/access]
- **SSH Key**: [Path to SSH key or access method]
- **SSH Command**: [Complete SSH command to connect]
- **Shared Directory**: [Any shared/mounted directories]
- **Purpose**: [What this VM is used for]
- **Status**: [Configured/Not yet configured]

## Git Configuration
- **Current Branch**: [Current git branch]
- **Main Branch**: [Default branch for PRs]
- **Remote**: [Remote repository location]

## Project-Specific Notes
[Any environment-specific notes, constraints, or configurations]
```

Always check for `ENVIRONMENT.md` when starting work and use it to understand:
- How to access VMs for testing
- What tools are available
- Any environment-specific constraints

## Project-Specific Guidelines

### Socket Abstraction Architecture
The project uses a multi-mode socket abstraction layer located in `src/socket/`:
- `mod.rs` - Core traits and types
- `factory.rs` - Socket factory with automatic fallback
- `icmp_v4.rs` - ICMP implementations
- `udp.rs` - UDP implementations (including Linux IP_RECVERR support)

### Error Handling
- Use OS error codes (EPERM=1, EACCES=13) instead of string matching for permission errors
- Check `io_err.raw_os_error()` for specific error codes

### Testing and Validation
- Always run `cargo fmt` before committing
- Always run `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` before committing (this matches GitHub Actions CI)
- Pre-commit hooks are configured in `.githooks/` - they run automatically
- Always run `cargo audit` after adding new modules or dependencies to catch security vulnerabilities early
- Always run `cargo outdated` before cutting a release to ensure dependencies are up to date
- **IMPORTANT**: GitHub Actions uses `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` which treats all warnings as errors

### Platform-Specific Code
- Use `#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]` for Linux-specific features
- The project supports Linux IP_RECVERR for UDP traceroute without root

### Commit Guidelines
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Include the robot emoji and Claude Code attribution:
  ```

  ```

### Command References
- Format code: `cargo fmt`
- Check formatting: `cargo fmt -- --check`
- Run linter: `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` (matches CI)
- Run tests: `cargo test`
- Build project: `cargo build`
- Run the binary: `sudo target/debug/ftr <hostname>`
- Check full compliance: `.githooks/check-compliance.sh`
- Release checklist: `.githooks/release-checklist.sh`
- Install dev tools: `.githooks/install-tools.sh`

### Important Files
- `Cargo.toml` - Dependencies and project metadata
- `src/main.rs` - Main entry point and CLI
- `src/socket/` - Socket abstraction layer
- `docs/MULTI_MODE.md` - Documentation for multi-mode probing
- `.githooks/pre-commit` - Pre-commit hook for formatting and linting

### Current Development Status
- v0.2.0 - Released with basic functionality
- v0.2.1 - Released with:
  - Socket abstraction layer with automatic fallback
  - Multi-mode support (Raw ICMP, DGRAM ICMP, UDP)
  - Linux IP_RECVERR support for privilege-free UDP traceroute
  - Multiple probes per TTL (-q/--queries option)
  - Improved error handling and diagnostics

### Known Limitations
- UDP mode requires either root privileges or Linux IP_RECVERR
- IPv6 support is not yet implemented
- TCP mode is not yet implemented
- Basic UDP socket (without ICMP reception) is non-functional and removed

## Git Best Practices

### File Operations
- **Always use git commands for file operations**:
  - Use `git mv` instead of deleting and recreating files
  - Use `git rm` to remove files
- **Never create test files or new versions of files directly** - create a branch for experiments and either discard or merge it
- **Ensure the directory is git clean before committing** - no untracked files or directories should remain

### Development Workflow
- **Always work on feature branches** - never commit new features directly to main
  - Create branches like `feature/v0.2.2` or `feature/json-output`
  - Merge to main only when feature is complete and tested
- **Keep commits small and well-scoped** - each commit should do one thing
- **Track work in TODO.md** - when new issues arise while working on something else, add them to TODO.md
- **Update TODO.md when completing work** - remove completed items
- **Update CHANGELOG.md** for notable or user-facing changes
- **Update README.md** if the project definition or scope changes
- **Run compliance checks before pushing** - use `.githooks/check-compliance.sh` to verify locally
- **Use release checklist** - run `.githooks/release-checklist.sh` before creating releases
- **NEVER check in untested code** - always verify scripts, configurations, and code changes work as expected before committing them

### Code Quality
- **Always write tests alongside code** - ensure tests pass in the commit hook
- **Avoid code duplication** - refactor common patterns
- **After each commit, review for refactoring opportunities**
- **Keep files small and modular** - each file should have a clear, single purpose
- **Use consistent naming** - follow Rust naming conventions (snake_case for functions/variables, CamelCase for types)
- **Comment complex logic** - make code easy to reason about

### Tool Requests
- **Feel free to ask for tools** - if you need tools like ripgrep to work more effectively, ask the user to install them

### Release Process
- **Before cutting any release**:
  1. Run `.githooks/release-checklist.sh` to ensure all checks pass
  2. Ensure `cargo outdated` shows all dependencies are up to date
  3. Update CHANGELOG.md with release notes
  4. Verify version number in Cargo.toml
  5. Ensure all tests pass and no TODO/FIXME items are critical
  6. **Prepare comprehensive release notes** including:
     - Summary of the release
     - New features with detailed descriptions
     - Bug fixes
     - Breaking changes (if any)
     - Installation/upgrade instructions
     - Acknowledgments
- **The release checklist script automatically**:
  - Checks git status and branch
  - Runs all compliance checks (format, clippy, tests, docs)
  - Runs security audit
  - Checks for outdated dependencies
  - Builds release binary and reports size
  - Validates CHANGELOG.md entries
  - **Prompts for release notes confirmation** (added in v0.2.2)
- **Creating the GitHub release**:
  - Use `gh release edit` to add comprehensive notes after tag is pushed
  - Include installation instructions for different platforms
  - Highlight major features and improvements
  - Provide clear upgrade path from previous versions

## Virtual Machine Guidelines

### Shared Directory Access
- **IMPORTANT**: The ftr directory is mounted at `/media/psf/ftr` in VMs - DO NOT copy files to/from the VM
- The mounted directory is shared between host and VM, so any changes are immediately visible in both places
- Access files directly from the mount point - no need for scp, rsync, or file copying
- Example: To run tests on Linux VM, just `ssh -i ~/.ssh/ftr_vm_key ftr@<VM_IP> "cd /media/psf/ftr && ./scripts/test.sh"`

### VM Development Workflow
- Build on the target platform (e.g., build Linux binaries on Linux VM)
- Use the shared mount to access source code and scripts
- Results and outputs are immediately available on both host and VM

## General Best Practices
1. Always read files before editing them
2. Check for existing patterns and follow them
3. Run tests after making changes
4. Keep changes focused and atomic
5. Document significant changes
6. Ask the user before making destructive operations
